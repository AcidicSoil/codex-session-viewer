Yes, you absolutely can create this as a separate standalone application outside of the Codex repository! <cite/>

## Standalone Implementation Approach

You would need to extract and reimplement the core session parsing logic from Codex. The key components you'd need to replicate are:

**Session File Parsing**: The JSONL format parsing logic from `RolloutRecorder` [1](#6-0)  that handles the session metadata and `ResponseItem` events.

**Data Structures**: You'd need to recreate the `ResponseItem` variants and `SessionMeta` structures from the `codex-protocol` crate [2](#6-1)  in your chosen language/framework.

## Technology Stack Freedom

As a standalone app, you could use any technology stack you prefer:

- **Web App**: React/Vue/Angular with Node.js backend
- **Desktop App**: Electron, Tauri, or native frameworks
- **Python**: Flask/FastAPI with a web frontend
- **Go**: Gin/Echo with embedded assets

## Implementation Considerations

**Session Discovery**: You'd need to implement your own session file discovery logic to scan the `.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/` directory structure.

**JSONL Parsing**: Handle the specific format where the first line contains session metadata and subsequent lines contain event data.

**ResponseItem Types**: Recreate the event type handling for messages, function calls, exec commands, patch applications, and reasoning events.

## Benefits of Standalone Approach

- **Technology Choice**: Use your preferred programming language and frameworks
- **Distribution**: Easier to package and distribute without Codex dependencies
- **Customization**: Full control over UI/UX without Codex constraints
- **Maintenance**: No need to sync with upstream Codex changes

## Trade-offs

- **Development Effort**: You'll need to reimplement session parsing logic instead of reusing existing utilities
- **Schema Sync**: Manual effort to keep up with any changes to Codex's session format
- **Testing**: Need to create your own test fixtures and validation

A standalone approach gives you complete flexibility but requires more initial development work to recreate the session parsing infrastructure that already exists in the Codex codebase.

## Notes

The session files are just JSONL text files, so any programming language can parse them. The main challenge is understanding and correctly handling all the different `ResponseItem` event types that Codex generates during sessions.
