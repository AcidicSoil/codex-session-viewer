		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Create File Tree Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Based on the existing files `FileTree.tsx`, `FileTreeNode.tsx`, and `fileTreeUtils.ts`, break this task down. The first subtask should focus on completing the tree-building logic in `fileTreeUtils.ts` to convert a flat list of file paths into a hierarchical data structure. The second should focus on implementing the recursive rendering in `FileTreeNode.tsx` to display the tree. The final subtask should be about handling state, specifically what happens when a file is clicked, including triggering an action and visually highlighting the selected node.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows that component files (`FileTree.tsx`, `FileTreeNode.tsx`, `fileTreeUtils.ts`) already exist. The task is 'in-progress', so the complexity is reduced from greenfield development to completing the implementation. The core challenge is the tree-building algorithm in `fileTreeUtils.ts`, which is moderately complex. The rest is straightforward recursive component rendering and state management."

			"taskId": 39,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Basic Diff Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "The `DiffViewer.tsx` component already exists. Break this down into two parts. First, implement the core `DiffViewer` component to accept `original` and `modified` content strings and correctly configure the `@monaco-editor/react` DiffEditor with these values and basic options. Second, integrate this component into the main `SessionView`, ensuring it receives the correct diff content when a file is selected in the `FileTree` component (from Task 38).",
			"reasoning": "A `DiffViewer.tsx` component file already exists. The task relies on the `@monaco-editor/react` library, which handles the heavy lifting of diff rendering. The complexity is low, primarily involving passing props from a parent component (driven by the file tree selection) to the Monaco editor component and setting up its initial configuration."

			"id": 41,
			"title": "Add Syntax Highlighting to Diff Viewer",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task enhances the existing `DiffViewer.tsx`. Break it down into two small subtasks. First, create a utility function `getLanguageForPath(path: string)` that takes a file path, extracts its extension, and returns the corresponding Monaco language ID (e.g., '.ts' -> 'typescript', '.py' -> 'python'). Second, modify the `DiffViewer` component to accept the file path as a prop, call this utility, and pass the resulting language to the Monaco Diff Editor's `language` option.",
			"reasoning": "This is a minor enhancement to an existing component (`DiffViewer.tsx`). The logic involves creating a simple utility function to map file extensions to language identifiers and passing an additional `language` prop to the Monaco editor. The implementation is straightforward and has a very small footprint."

			"taskId": 48,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Session Library with IndexedDB",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-defined with 7 subtasks. The current breakdown is excellent. Please proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each of the existing subtasks, starting with 'Define IndexedDB Schema and Create DB Service'. Ensure the plan uses the `idb` library for simplicity and includes robust error handling for all DB operations, as well as graceful degradation if IndexedDB is unavailable.",
			"reasoning": "This is a large feature that introduces a persistence layer. It involves schema design, creating a data access layer (`session-db.ts`), building new UI components (`SessionLibrary.tsx`), and integrating with the existing file loading flow (`useFileLoader.ts`). Working with IndexedDB, even with a library like `idb`, adds significant complexity due to its asynchronous nature, version management, and error handling requirements. The existing 7 subtasks accurately reflect this high complexity."

			"taskId": 53,
			"taskTitle": "Package as Web App or NPM Package (replace Electron)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is well-decomposed into 7 subtasks covering both the static web app and npm package distribution paths. The plan is solid. Please proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each subtask, starting with 'Decide distribution targets and package naming'. Pay close attention to the `vite.config.ts` changes for library mode and the `package.json` `exports` map, as these are critical and error-prone for the npm package.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves no application logic changes but is complex due to its focus on build tooling and packaging. Configuring Vite for both SPA and library builds, correctly setting up `package.json` fields (`exports`, `peerDependencies`, etc.), and creating a verification process are non-trivial. The complexity lies in the configuration details and potential for cross-environment issues, not in writing React components."

			"taskId": 54,
			"taskTitle": "All Sessions View (auto-discovery + selector)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task has a solid 6-subtask breakdown. The plan correctly leverages the existing `useAutoDiscovery` hook. Proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each subtask, starting with 'Create `SessionsList` Component Scaffold'. Ensure the plan uses the project's existing UI library (e.g., Chakra UI) for the modal and list components, and details the `fetch -> Blob -> File` logic for loading a selected session.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis indicates a `useAutoDiscovery` hook already exists, providing the necessary data. The task is therefore primarily UI development. It involves creating a new modal and a list component with stateful search/sort (`SessionsList.tsx`), and wiring it into `App.tsx`. The complexity is medium as it requires building new, non-trivial UI components and interaction logic, but it leverages existing data-fetching logic."

			"taskId": 55,
			"taskTitle": "Reload Sessions Button (re-scan without page refresh)",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task and its 6 subtasks are marked as 'done'. The breakdown was excellent, covering the hook refactoring, UI integration in two places, loading state feedback, debouncing, and testing. No further expansion is needed. If this were a new task, the prompt would be: 'Break this down into subtasks covering: 1. Refactoring `useAutoDiscovery` to expose a `reload` function. 2. Adding the UI button to the main view. 3. Adding the button to the `AllSessionsView`. 4. Implementing loading state feedback. 5. Adding debounce logic. 6. Writing unit tests for the refactored hook.'",
			"reasoning": "The task is marked as complete. The original complexity was moderate (4/10) because it required refactoring a core hook (`useAutoDiscovery`) to expose new functionality, updating multiple UI consumers (`App.tsx`, `AllSessionsView.tsx`) with the new state (`isLoading`) and actions (`reload`), and implementing non-trivial logic like debouncing. The 6 completed subtasks accurately reflect this scope."

			"taskId": 56,
			"taskTitle": "Newest-First Sorting for Detected Sessions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is nearly complete, with only the unit tests for the timestamp parser remaining. The expansion should focus solely on subtask 56.5: 'Write Unit Tests for Timestamp Parser'. The prompt should be: 'Create a comprehensive test suite in `src/utils/timestamp.test.ts` for the `parseTimestampFromPath` function. Ensure you cover all specified patterns (rollout-style, ISO-like, YYYY/MM/DD paths), as well as edge cases like malformed dates, paths with no dates, and paths with multiple potential timestamps to verify priority.'",
			"reasoning": "Most subtasks are 'done'. The core complexity was in creating a robust timestamp parsing utility (`src/utils/timestamp.ts`) with regex to handle multiple formats, which is moderately difficult. The remaining work is to write unit tests for this utility. The overall task involved touching the data hook, multiple UI components, and adding new utility code, justifying a medium complexity score."

			"taskId": 57,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Diff Viewer Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "This is a large feature enhancement with an excellent 8-subtask breakdown. The plan covers parser improvements, new UI controls, and testing. Proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each subtask, starting with 'Enhance Diff Parser for Headerless and Hunkless Diffs'. Pay special attention to the unit tests for the parser to ensure its new resilience doesn't cause regressions.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a significant enhancement of the `DiffViewer`. The complexity is high due to the combination of multiple distinct features: refactoring a diff parser to be more resilient (a tricky and high-risk task), adding a suite of new UI controls (toggles, buttons), handling edge cases like binary/large files, and the corresponding testing effort. The 8 well-defined subtasks confirm the large scope."

			"taskTitle": "Filterâ€‘Aware Granular Export",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task and its 9 subtasks are marked as 'done'. The breakdown was comprehensive, covering everything from spec definition to UI, a Web Worker pipeline, and testing. No further expansion is needed. If this were a new task, the prompt would be: 'This is a highly complex feature. Use the existing 9 subtasks as a guide to create a detailed implementation plan. Start with defining the data spec, then build the data transformation pipeline, implement the exporters (CSV/JSON), wrap it in a Web Worker, build the UI modal, and finally add tests and docs.'",
			"reasoning": "This task is marked as complete, but its original scope was highly complex. Codebase analysis shows dedicated `export` and `export/worker` directories. The feature required a Web Worker for performance, deep integration with state management (Zustand) to respect filters, a complex UI modal for granular selection, and multiple data formatters. This combination of performance optimization, complex UI, and data transformation pipelines makes it one of the most challenging features."

			"taskId": 59,
			"taskTitle": "Theme Color Picker + Light/Dark Mode",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task has an excellent 8-subtask breakdown for adding a complete theming system. The plan correctly identifies using CSS variables with Tailwind and a Zustand store for persistence. Proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each subtask, starting with 'Specify theme tokens and mode behavior'. The plan should detail how to set up the CSS variables in a global stylesheet and reference them in `tailwind.config.ts`.",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield feature of moderate complexity. It requires foundational changes to the app's styling by integrating CSS variables with `tailwind.config.ts`. The complexity comes from coordinating multiple parts: the Tailwind setup, a new Zustand store with `localStorage` persistence, a UI for the theme picker, and logic to handle the 'system' preference. While not algorithmically difficult, the number of interconnected pieces is significant."

			"taskId": 60,
			"taskTitle": "Workspace Scanner for CWD + .codex/sessions (diff tracking)",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "This is a very large and complex feature with a 10-subtask breakdown. The plan correctly identifies the major components: using the File System Access API, performant scanning/hashing, IndexedDB for persistence, and change detection. Proceed with generating detailed implementation steps for each subtask, starting with 'Decide directory access + security approach'. The plan must emphasize performance (using async generators or workers for scanning) and robust error/permission handling for the File System Access API.",
			"reasoning": "This is an extremely complex, high-impact feature. It introduces a new paradigm of interacting with the local file system, akin to a lightweight version control system. The complexity stems from using the advanced File System Access API, the critical need for high performance when scanning large directories (requiring workers or yielding loops), managing cryptographic hashing, and persisting large snapshots and directory handles in IndexedDB. Each of the 10 subtasks represents a significant engineering effort."
