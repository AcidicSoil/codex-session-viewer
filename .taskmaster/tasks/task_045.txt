# Task ID: 45
# Title: Implement Export to Markdown
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 40, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a function to export a summary of the session, or a selection of events, into a Markdown file.
# Details:
Transform the selected `ResponseItem` objects into a human-readable Markdown format. For example, format `Message` events as blockquotes and `LocalShellCall` events as code blocks. Trigger a client-side download.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Bookmark a few key events, export as Markdown, and open the file to verify its formatting and content.
