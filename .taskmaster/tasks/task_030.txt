# Task ID: 30
# Title: Define Core Data Models in TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 29
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the TypeScript interfaces for the application's data layer, including SessionMeta, ResponseItem, FileChange, and ParsedSession.
# Details:
Create a `types.ts` or similar file to define the interfaces as specified in the PRD's 'Data Layer' section. Ensure types are exported for use across the application.

# Test Strategy:
Code review to ensure type definitions match the PRD. TypeScript compiler should pass without errors when these types are imported and used.
