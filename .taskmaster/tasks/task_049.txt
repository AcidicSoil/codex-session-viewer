# Task ID: 49
# Title: Optimize Large-File Parsing with a Web Worker
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: low
# Description: Move the JSONL parsing logic into a Web Worker to prevent it from blocking the main UI thread when opening very large files.
# Details:
Refactor the parser to run in a separate worker script. Use `postMessage` to communicate parsing progress, final results, or errors back to the main thread, which then updates the UI.

# Test Strategy:
Test loading a very large file (e.g., 100MB+) and verify that the UI remains responsive (e.g., spinners animate smoothly) during the parsing process.
