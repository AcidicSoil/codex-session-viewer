# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Session Loading via File Picker
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a UI component that allows users to open a `.jsonl` file using the browser's native file picker.
# Details:
Use the Browser File API (`<input type='file'>`) to let users select a file. On selection, pass the file to the JSONL parser and update the application state with the parsed session data.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Click a button, select a valid `.jsonl` file, and verify that the session data is loaded into the application's state.
