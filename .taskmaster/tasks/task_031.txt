# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Streaming JSONL Parser
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust parser for `.jsonl` session files that can handle large files by streaming and processing them line by line.
# Details:
The parser should read a File object, process it incrementally, and parse each line as a JSON object. The first line is `SessionMeta`, and subsequent lines are `ResponseItem` events. Implement basic error recovery for malformed JSON lines.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the parser with valid, large, and malformed `.jsonl` files. Test performance to meet the '< 2s for 10MB file' metric.
