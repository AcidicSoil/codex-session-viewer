# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Basic Full-Text Search
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a search input that allows users to perform a case-insensitive text search across all events in the timeline.
# Details:
Create an in-memory search index or filter the `events` array based on the search query. Highlight matching text in the event cards and provide a way to navigate between results.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Load a session, type a query, and verify that the timeline filters to show only matching events and that text is highlighted.
