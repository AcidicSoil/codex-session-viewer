# Task ID: 25
# Title: Architect Plugin System for Custom Events
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Design a system that allows for the registration of custom event types and their corresponding renderers.
# Details:
Define a plugin API where a developer can provide a schema for a new event type and a React component to render it. This will allow the application to be extended without modifying the core codebase.

# Test Strategy:
Create a proof-of-concept plugin for a new 'CustomToolCall' event type. Verify that the application can load and render it correctly.
