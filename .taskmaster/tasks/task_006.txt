# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Virtualized Timeline View for Events
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main chronological event stream using a virtualized list for performance.
# Details:
Use a library like `react-window` to efficiently render a potentially large number of events. The view should display a list of event cards in chronological order.

# Test Strategy:
Load a session with thousands of events and verify smooth scrolling performance. Check that interaction latency is < 100ms and memory usage is reasonable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research/select virtualization library [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate react-window and tanstack-virtual for large lists; choose one based on API and perf.
### Details:


## 2. Create TimelineView wrapper [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build a TimelineView component that encapsulates the virtualizer and exposes a simple props API.
### Details:


## 3. Wire events into virtualized list [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Pass the event array to the virtualizer with stable keys and render row components.
### Details:


## 4. Handle dynamic item heights [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement measurement/estimation for varying card heights to keep scroll positions accurate.
### Details:


## 5. Perf test at scale [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Benchmark smoothness and memory usage with â‰¥5,000 events and interactions.
