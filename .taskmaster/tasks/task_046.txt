# Task ID: 46
# Title: Ensure Responsive UI Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34, 35, 38
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refine the application's layout to be responsive and usable across different screen sizes, from mobile to large desktops.
# Details:
Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust flex layouts, panel visibility, and font sizes. Test common breakpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Resize the browser window or use browser developer tools to simulate different devices. Verify the layout adapts gracefully without breaking.
