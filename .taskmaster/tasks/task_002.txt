# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Core Data Models in TypeScript
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create TypeScript interfaces for all data structures as defined in the PRD's Technical Architecture section.
# Details:
Implement `SessionMeta`, `ResponseItem` (with its variants), `FileChange`, `Artifact`, and `ParsedSession` interfaces. Ensure types are strict and well-documented to match the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Code review to ensure interfaces match the PRD. The TypeScript compiler should pass without errors when using the defined types.
