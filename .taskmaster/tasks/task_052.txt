# Task ID: 52
# Title: Enhance Accessibility (a11y)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 46
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform an accessibility audit and implement improvements, including full keyboard navigation, semantic regions, and color-blind safe markers.
# Details:
Ensure all interactive elements are focusable and have clear focus states. Use ARIA attributes where necessary. Add distinct visual markers (e.g., patterns, icons) to diffs in addition to color.

# Test Strategy:
Manual audit using keyboard-only navigation. Run automated accessibility checkers like Axe. Test color-blind safe markers with a simulator.
