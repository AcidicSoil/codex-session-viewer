# Status: done
# Dependencies: 40, 43
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a function to export the current view of events (all, filtered, or bookmarked) as a JSON file.
# Details:
The function will collect the relevant `ResponseItem` objects, serialize them to a JSON string, create a Blob, and trigger a client-side download.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Filter the timeline, click 'Export to JSON', and verify the downloaded file contains only the filtered events.
