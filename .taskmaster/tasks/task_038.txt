# Task ID: 38
# Title: Create File Tree Component
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a component that displays a tree view of all files that were modified during the session.
# Details:
Derive the file structure from the `fileChanges` array in the `ParsedSession` object. Clicking a file should trigger an action to show its diff.

# Test Strategy:
Component test with a mock `fileChanges` array. Manual test: Load a session with file changes and verify the tree is accurate.
