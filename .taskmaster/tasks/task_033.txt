# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Session Loading via Drag-and-Drop
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a drag-and-drop zone to the main application window for opening `.jsonl` files.
# Details:
Implement event listeners for `dragover`, `dragleave`, and `drop` events. On drop, access the file from the `DataTransfer` object and process it with the JSONL parser.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Drag a `.jsonl` file from the desktop onto the application window and verify the session loads correctly.
