# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Session File Loading UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface for opening `.jsonl` files via a file picker or drag-and-drop.
# Details:
Use the browser's File API. Create a drop zone and a file input button. On file load, pass the file to the JSONL parser. Manage loading states (e.g., parsing, error).

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: successfully load a file via both drag-and-drop and the file picker. Test edge cases like loading non-`.jsonl` files or multiple files.
