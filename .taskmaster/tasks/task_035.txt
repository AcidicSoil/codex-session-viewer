# Task ID: 35
# Title: Build Virtualized Timeline for Events
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the main chronological event stream using a virtualized list to ensure performance with a large number of events.
# Details:
Use a library like `react-window` to render only the visible event items. The list will be fed the `events` array from the `ParsedSession` object.

# Test Strategy:
Test with a session containing thousands of events to confirm smooth scrolling and low memory usage. Interaction latency should be < 100ms.
