# Task ID: 36
# Title: Develop Basic Event Card Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a generic React component to render a single event within the timeline. It should display the event type and a summary of its content.
# Details:
The component will take a `ResponseItem` as a prop and use a switch statement or mapping to render different content based on the event `type` (e.g., 'Message', 'FunctionCall').

# Test Strategy:
Component tests for each supported event type to ensure correct rendering. Visual regression testing can be beneficial here.
