# Task ID: 42
# Title: Create Command History Timeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a dedicated view or filter that isolates `LocalShellCall` events to show a clear history of commands and their outputs.
# Details:
This could be a special filter on the main timeline or a separate panel. It should clearly pair each command with its corresponding standard output and error streams.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Load a session with shell commands and activate the command view. Verify that all commands and their outputs are displayed chronologically and are easy to read.
