# Task ID: 34
# Title: Create Session Metadata Display Panel
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a React component to display the parsed session metadata, such as timestamp, instructions, and git info.
# Details:
The component will receive the `SessionMeta` object as a prop and render its contents in a clear, readable format. This will be part of the main session view.

# Test Strategy:
Component test: Pass a mock `SessionMeta` object and verify all fields are displayed correctly. Manual test: Load a session and check the panel.
