# Task ID: 47
# Title: Implement Deep Linking and URL State
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Preserve the application state (like selected event, filter settings) in the URL hash to allow for sharing specific views.
# Details:
Use a library or custom hook to serialize the relevant state to the URL hash. On page load, parse the hash to restore the application state. This enables permalinks.

# Test Strategy:
Manual test: Apply a filter, select an event, copy the URL. Open the URL in a new tab and verify the application loads in the exact same state.
